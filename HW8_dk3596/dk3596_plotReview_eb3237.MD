### Plot: Comparison of median rents of the Studio apartments in the Financial district and Southwest Brooklyn in New York City.


## CLARITY: 

1. The plot is very clear and easy to read. The lines are not cumbersome.
I personally would like to see the lines for the the rents of the two neighborhoods more sick, but this is not necessary.

2. The axes have correct lables with proper units. However, the X axis starts with 2014-11, whereas there is no data for that period. The data starts from somewhere in 2015, so X axis should be amended. 

3. The legend with the relevant descriptions is located in the top right corner, which is visially correct.

4. The caption clearly conveys the message. One thing - it is not clear what are the dates for the max and min differences between the two neighborhoods tha author referring to, would be good to add them.

 5. The title can be improved by saying exactly what the author said in the first papagraph, i.e. 
 "The comparison of median rents of the studio apartments in the Financial district and Southwest Brooklyn in New York City in 2015-2018" 



## ESTHETIC: 

1. The plot looks very nice visualy. A good balance of graphical content and relevant information. 

2. Good choice of colors. 

## HONESTY: 

The plot is honest and reproducing the data correctly, except for the missing information for 2014-11 (see above).


## SUGGESTION: 

This simple and clear plot helped the author to convey a lot of information in an effective way. 
Only a few minor changes in the "clarity" section, namely, amending the title, the X axis and making more clear caption in regards to exate date for the "max" and "min" differences
