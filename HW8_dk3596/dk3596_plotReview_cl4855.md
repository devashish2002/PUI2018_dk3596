The maximum and minimum differences between the rents of the two neighborhoods is also shown by vertical lines. It can be seen that the median rent has a slighly increasing rate from 2015 to 2018 for Southwest Brooklyn while the median rent in the Financial district remians almost the same with no increasing or decreasing rate explicit.

## Clarity:
The plot is easy to read and clear. It shows how the rent will be different between financial district and southwest Brooklyn. And also presents the date of max and minimum difference. 

## Esthetic:
Simple is the best! But I'm not sure if the max and minimum difference part is necessary for the time series seem to have no obvious trend. 


## Honesty:
The plot honestly reproduced the data.
