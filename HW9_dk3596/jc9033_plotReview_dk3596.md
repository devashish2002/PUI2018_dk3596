## Plot: FDNY Avarage Response Time against the Monthly number of Incidents in the last 8 years

## Clarity:

- The figure is clear with all labels, titles and legend clearly readable. The size of the plot
 including the font size of all text is also proper.
 
 - The author could add the unit of the y label (Average response time) in the text. It 
 is not clear about how the time is measured here.
 
 - It can also be added about which area the response time is being plotted here. From the 
 title, one can guess that the area could be New York (FDNY) but I feel a proper mention 
 of the area should be there because the area can be a part of New York City.
 
 - Also, it can be mentioned in the legend about how the linear regression line is fitted 
 to the data. Because there are different ways of minimizing the error and fitting a line, 
 a mention about the process can be added.
 
 ## Aesthetics:
 
 The plot is showing all the data that the author is trying to show and the color choice is is also proper.
 
 ## Honesty:
 
 All the data is plotted in the plot with no bias whatsoever.
 
 ## Changes:
 
 Mention of units of time in y label, addition of the area about which the data is plotted 
 and the fitted model description can be added.
