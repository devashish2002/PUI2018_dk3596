## Plot: Average sales price by zipcode in Staten Island in 2016

## Clarity:

- The plot(map) is easy to read and the size is proper. Apart from the zip code '10314', which is a little difficult to read as it clashes with the boundary of the area, all the 
zip codes can be seen in their respective areas with clear boundaries.

- I feel a change can be made in the range of sale prices for which the classification is made. 
One has to look at the legend for a while to understand the range of values of the different 
categories. For example, it can be made more intuitive by starting the price from $400,000 and
 making classes for every $50,000.
 
- In the values for the legend, the currency of the sale prices could be added ($).

## Aesthetics:

- The map looks clear and simple and the choice of colors is proper and intuitive.

## Honesty:

- The map is showing all the data including the zipcodes and the sale prices of all the areas.

## Changes:

- The main changes may include the simpler ranges for classification and the addition of 
the currency we are dealing here in the legend. Also, the depiction of zip '10314' can be made 
clearer by reducing the font size or shifting the text position.
