## City Bike Review By Borong Lyu (bl2621)


I think Devashish Khulbe(dk3596) has done a great job! The idea that Younger persons tend to ride bikes longer than older persons is very interesting.
  
I think the null and alternative hypothesizes are appropriate.
  
 If a formula is required, the following formulas should be included:
 
  $H_0$ : ${\mu_{\mathrm{{[25 or younger\:tripduration]}}}} <= {\mu_{\mathrm{[older than 25\:tripduration]}}}$

$H_a$ : ${\mu_{\mathrm{{[25 or younger\:tripduration]}}}} > {\mu_{\mathrm{[older than 25\:tripduration]}}}$
  
 The appropriate features to answer the question are included, and Devashish properly pre-processed the data to extract the needed values. Moreover, it is a great idea to drop the missing values. 

But I don't think it is necessary to make the two sample sizes equal to each other. 
n1 and n2 are both considered in the t test formula. 


### Two-sample t test （2 groups unpaired t test ）for difference of means is the most appropriate test here. 


To make this question more interesting, we could test if men under the age of 25 tend to ride longer than women under the age of 25. Or men who are older than 25 ride longer than women older than 25.
